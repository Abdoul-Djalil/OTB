are cross-compiled with MinGW, for 32 bits and 64 bits platforms. They
contain all applications and their launchers (both command line and graphical
launchers are provided).
Check the `Download page <https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download>`__

There is a 32 bits and a 64 bits version. They contain the same directory
structure:

-  ``monteverdi.bat`` : A launcher script for Monteverdi

-  ``mapla.bat`` : A launcher script for Mapla

-  ``otbenv.bat`` : A script to initialize the environment for OTB
   executables

-  ``bin`` : A folder containing application launchers (otbcli.bat,
   otbgui.bat) and the DLLs.

-  ``lib`` : A folder containing application DLLs.

The applications can be launched from the Mapla launcher. If you want to
use the otbcli and otbgui launchers, you can initialize a command prompt
with ``otbenv.bat``.
