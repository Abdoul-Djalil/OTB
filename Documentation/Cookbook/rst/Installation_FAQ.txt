Q: I am getting an error message...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   Cannot mix incompatible Qt library (version 0x40806) with this library (version 0x40807)
   Aborted

A: This is due to a conflict with system Qt4 (usually seen on KDE) and Qt4 + gtk libs in OTB package. The fix you need is to remove those libs from package.

.. parsed-literal::

   cd /path/to/OTB-|release|-Linux64
   rm -f lib/libQt* && rm -fr lib/gtk

Q: Monteverdi and Mapla applications look different from my other applications.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: By default, Monteverdi, Mapla and otbapplication (otbgui\_\*) uses a default gtk theme (plastic)
which is distributed with the OTB package!.  We do this to be on safe side, like when a user does
not have gtk libraries installed when using our package.

gtk libraries in the package is  the reason why you are getting a default "plastic" look & feel that
makes it look different from other GUI applications.
To get same look and feel, you can "force"  Monteverdi and Mapla to use system GTK.

::

   export OTB_USE_SYSTEM_GTK=1

And now start ``monteverdi.sh`` or ``mapla.sh`` from OTB-|release|-Linux64
To get back default behaviour, unset OTB_USE_SYSTEM_GTK=1 or set OTB_USE_SYSTEM_GTK=0
