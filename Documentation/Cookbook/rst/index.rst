Welcome to OTB CookBook's documentation!
========================================

`Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) <http://orfeo-toolbox.org>`_ is an open source project for state-of-the-art remote
sensing. Built on the shoulders of the open-source geospatial community, it can
process high resolution optical, multispectral and radar images at the terabyte
scale. A wide variety of applications are available: from ortho-rectification or
pansharpening, all the way to classification, SAR processing, and much more!

All of OTB's algorithms are accessible from its graphical interface called
Monteverdi, from QGIS, Python, the command line or C++. Monteverdi is an easy to
use, hardware accelerated visualization tool for satellite images in sensor
geometry. With it, end-users can visualize huge raw imagery products
and access all of the applications in the toolbox. From ressource limited
laptops to high performance clusters, OTB is available on Windows, Linux and
Mac. It is community driven, extensible and heavily documented.
Orfeo ToolBox is not a black box!

This is the CookBook documentation for users. If you are new to OTB and
Monteverdi, start here. It will go through how to install OTB on your system,
how to start using Monteverdi and OTB applications to view and process your
data, and recipies on how to accomplish typical remote sensing tasks.
Finally, there is also documentation on every application shipped with OTB.

For other documentation, be sure to read:

- `OTB Software Guide <http://orfeo-toolbox.org/SoftwareGuide/>`_ for advanced users and developers.
  The software guide contains documented code examples,
  descriptions of the ITK pipeline model, multithreading and
  streaming functionalities, and an introduction to the C++ API.
- `Doxygen <http://orfeo-toolbox.org/doxygen/>`_, for exhaustive documentation
  of the C++ API.
