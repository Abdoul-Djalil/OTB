We provide for Linux 64 bits OS through standalone packages. They contain
all OTB Applications and their launchers (both command line and
graphical launchers are provided). Check the `Download page <https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download>`__

This package is a self-extractible archive. You may uncompress it with a
double-click on the file, or with the command line :

.. parsed-literal::

   chmod +x OTB-|release|-Linux64.run
   ./OTB-|release|-Linux64.run

Please note that the resulting installation is not meant to be moved,
you should uncompress the archive in its final location. Once the
archive is extracted, the directory structure is made of:

-  ``monteverdi.sh`` : A launcher script for Monteverdi

-  ``mapla.sh`` : A launcher script for Mapla

-  ``otbenv.profile`` : A script to initialize the environment for OTB
   executables

-  ``bin`` : A folder containing application launchers (otbcli.sh,
   otbgui.sh), Monteverdi and Mapla.

-  ``lib`` : A folder containing all shared libraries and OTB
   applications.

-  ``share`` : A folder containing common resources and copyright
   mentions.

In order to run the command line launchers, this package doesnâ€™t require
any special library that is not present in most modern Linux
distributions. The graphical executable (otbgui launchers, Monteverdi
and Mapla) use the X11 libraries, which are widely used in a lot of
distributions :

::

    libx11-6 libxext6 libxau6 libxxf86vm1 libxdmcp6 libdrm2

Monteverdi also requires the standard graphics libraries libgl1 and
libglu1. Make sure you have at least one version of them installed
in your system.

The applications can be launched from the Mapla launcher. If you want to
use the otbcli and otbgui launchers, you can initialize your environment
with ``source otbenv.profile``.

Notes:

- You must use monteverdi and mapla through ``mapla.sh`` and ``monteverdi.sh`` helper scripts in extracted directory.

- The helper scripts for monteverdi and mapla set required environment variables

- You might be tempted to move "OTB-|release|-Linux64" into another location say /usr/local/ after extraction. But avoid this action!

- To have "OTB-|release|-Linux64" installed in /usr/local or /opt execute "OTB-|release|-Linux64.run" in that directory.

- Multiple installation of OTB can exists in same system without one conflicting the other!
