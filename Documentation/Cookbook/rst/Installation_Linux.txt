We provide a binary package for GNU/Linux x86_64. This package includes
all of the OTB applications along with command line and graphical launchers.
It can be downloaded from `OTB's download page
<https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download>`__.

This package is a self-extractable archive. You may uncompress it with a
double-click on the file, or from the command line as follows:

.. parsed-literal::

   chmod +x OTB-|release|-Linux64.run
   ./OTB-|release|-Linux64.run

The self-extractable archive only needs common tools found on most Linux
distributions ("sed", "grep", "find", "cat", "printf", "ln", ...). However, be
aware that it requires tools such as "which" and "file" (they are not always
present, for instance when building a container).

Please note that the resulting installation is not meant to be moved,
you should uncompress the archive in its final location. Once the
archive is extracted, the directory structure consists of:

-  ``monteverdi.sh``: A launcher script for Monteverdi

-  ``mapla.sh``: A launcher script for Mapla

-  ``otbenv.profile``: A script to initialize the environment for OTB
   executables

-  ``bin``: A folder containing application launchers (otbcli.sh,
   otbgui.sh), Monteverdi and Mapla.

-  ``lib``: A folder containing all shared libraries and OTB
   applications.

-  ``share``: A folder containing common resources and copyright
   mentions.

-  ``tool``: A folder containing usefull scripts to test the installation or
   to uninstall OTB libraries and headers while keeping all the depedencies.

In order to run the command line launchers, this package doesnâ€™t require
any special library that is not present in most modern Linux
distributions. There is a small caveat for "expat" though as these binaries depend
on "libexpat.so", which can be supplied by most package managers (apt, yum, ...).
Note that this problem only affects versions 6.0 and older.
If not already present, it is necessary to install one of the following packages:

::

    libexpat-dev   libexpat1-dev

The graphical executable (otbgui launchers, Monteverdi
and Mapla) use the X11 libraries, which are widely used in a lot of
distributions:

::

    libx11-6 libxext6 libxau6 libxxf86vm1 libxdmcp6 libdrm2

Monteverdi also requires the standard graphics libraries libgl1 and
libglu1. Make sure you have at least one version of them installed
in your system.

The applications can be launched from the Mapla launcher. If you want to
use the otbcli and otbgui launchers, you can initialize your environment
with ``source otbenv.profile``.

Python bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from OTB 5.8.0, OTB Python bindings are distributed with binary package.
Currently only Python 2.x is supported and if no compatible Python version is found a
notification is generated during the installation process.  If the installation completes
without issue, information relating to your Python bindings will be provided. 

You must have Python numpy bindings installed in your system. They can be installed locally
without admin rights as follows: "pip install --user numpy". This is to give users the option 
to select their own existing Python installation rather than the one dibstributed by the OTB package.


Notes:

- You must use monteverdi and mapla through ``mapla.sh`` and ``monteverdi.sh`` helper scripts in extracted directory.

- The helper scripts for monteverdi and mapla set required environment variables

- You might be tempted to move "OTB-|release|-Linux64" into another location say /usr/local/ after extraction. But avoid this action!

- To have "OTB-|release|-Linux64" installed in /usr/local or /opt execute "OTB-|release|-Linux64.run" in that directory.

- Multiple installation of OTB can exists in same system without one conflicting the other!

FAQ
~~~

Q: I am getting an error message...
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

::

   Cannot mix incompatible Qt library (version 0x40806) with this library (version 0x40807)
   Aborted

A: This is due to a conflict with system Qt4 (usually seen on KDE) and Qt4 + gtk libs in OTB package. The fix you need is to remove those libs from package.

.. parsed-literal::

   cd /path/to/OTB-|release|-Linux64
   rm -f lib/libQt* && rm -fr lib/gtk

Q: Monteverdi and Mapla applications look different from my other applications.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A: In versions 6.0 and older, Monteverdi, Mapla and otbapplication (otbgui\_\*)
use the system gtk theme. If you can't install GTK on your system you can use the
one distributed with the OTB package. Note that using system GTK is the preferred
way with the OTB standalone package as the distributed version of GTK do not
work on recent Linux distributions. 

To use the distributed GTK libraries you need to set the OTB_USE_LOCAL_GTK:

::

   export OTB_USE_LOCAL_GTK=1

And now start ``monteverdi.sh`` or ``mapla.sh`` from OTB-|release|-Linux64
To get back default behaviour, unset OTB_USE_LOCAL_GTK=1 or set OTB_USE_LOCAL_GTK=0

In version 6.2, the Linux binaries are built without GTK support to cut some
dependencies.
