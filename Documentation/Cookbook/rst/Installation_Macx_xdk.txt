Synopsis
--------

This archive provides a development kit for the ORFEO ToolBox library which
allows to easily compile OTB and facilitate the creation of programs based on
OTB.

It contains shared libraries of OTB dependencies and helper scripts for the
configuration and the compilation of the library.

Note that OTB sources are not included in the archive (see instructions below).

Prerequisites
-------------

-  cmake (>= 3.2)
-  AppleClang (>= 6.0)
-  Xcode (>= 6.1.1)
-  git (optional)

Extract Package
---------------

::

    cd /opt (You can use another a directory of your own choice)
    chmod +x OTB-|release|-xdk-Darwin64.run
    ./OTB-|release|-xdk-Darwin64.run

**You now will have a directory named **OTB-|release|-xdk-Darwin64** in **/opt**

Setup environment
-----------------
There is a helper script in package called **otbenv.profile**. This script export
required environments to configure and build OTB.

::

    cd /opt/OTB-|release|-xdk-Darwin64
    . ./otbenv.profile

Test environment setup by checking value of CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

::

    echo $CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

The above command will output:
 /opt/OTB-|release|-xdk-Darwin64
 

Configure and build your OTB Project
---------------------------------

::

    mkdir -p ~/ex1_HelloWorld/build && cd ~/ex1_HelloWorld/build
    cmake ~/ex1_HelloWorld/src -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=c++11'
